                Thanks for checking out this section, means a lot. The idea for the site came when I was getting into cooking. Since I didn't really know what I was doing, that
                meant I was looking up <em>plenty</em> of recipes. I grew frustrated when literally recipe website I'd come across had a chapter of a book attached to it, and sometimes
                the recipe wasn't really presented in an easy to read manner. Finally; I got so frustrated and created <a href={window.location.origin}>this website</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm always looking for ways to improve the site and am welcoming of any feedback. I just hope that if it's critical it's also constructive. If you have any ideas please
              checkout the previous page (you can go back below), theres a place to report bugs & suggest features.
            </p>
            <p> Thanks for swinging by! </p>
